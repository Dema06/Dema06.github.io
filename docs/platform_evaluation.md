## Selected Platform: Tidio

After careful evaluation, I chose **Tidio** as the platform to develop our demonstration e-commerce chatbot for the following reasons:

1. **Excellent ease of use**: Tidio offers a very intuitive interface that allows you to quickly create a functional chatbot without the need for advanced technical skills.

2. **Generous free plan**: Tidio's free plan allows you to create a chatbot with sufficient functionality for a complete demonstration example, without excessive limitations.

3. **Good e-commerce functionality**: Tidio supports all the conversation flows necessary for an e-commerce chatbot, including product assistance, order tracking, and returns management.

4. **Excellent website integration**: Tidio integrates easily with any website via a simple code snippet, making it easy to demonstrate the chatbot in a real context.

5. **Combination of chatbot and live chat**: This feature is particularly useful for e-commerce, allowing smooth transfer from automated interactions to human operators when necessary.

## Implementation Approach

To implement the demonstration chatbot with Tidio, we will follow this approach:

1. We will create a local simulation of the chatbot using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to show the interface and conversation flows.

2. We will implement dialogues based on the examples provided in the documentation.

3. We will show how this chatbot could be integrated into a real e-commerce site using Tidio.

4. We will provide detailed instructions on how to replicate this demonstration chatbot on Tidio for real use.

This approach will allow us to create a complete and functional example that the user can easily adapt and implement using Tidio or other similar platforms.
