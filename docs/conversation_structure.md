# E-commerce Chatbot Conversation Structure

Based on the analyzed documentation, I have designed the following conversational structure for our demonstration e-commerce chatbot. This structure defines the main conversation flows and interactions that the chatbot will be able to handle.

## 1. Welcome Flow and Main Menu

### Trigger: User opens the chat or visits the site
- **Welcome message**: "Welcome to TechStyle store! I'm your virtual assistant and I'm here to help you. How can I assist you today?"
- **Main options**:
  - Search for products
  - Track an order
  - Returns and refunds information
  - Payment assistance
  - Speak with a human agent

### Decision logic:
- If user selects an option → Redirect to corresponding flow
- If user types free text → Analyze intent and redirect to appropriate flow
- If user is a returning customer → Personalize welcome message

## 2. Product Search Flow

### Trigger: User selects "Search for products" or asks for product information
- **Category request**: "Great choice! What are you looking for today?"

## 3. Order Tracking Flow

### Trigger: User selects "Track an order" or asks about their order status

## 9. Human Operator Transfer Flow
